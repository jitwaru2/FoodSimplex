FoodSimplex
===========

If:

1) you're a bodybuilder
2) your next meal has to have exactly 300 calories, 20 grams of protein, 7 grams of fat, and 12 grams of carbs
3) you're only willing to eat tostitos, jellybeans, and chicken

put the macronutrient values for 1 serving each of tostitos, jellybeans, and chicken, and the Food Simplex will tell you how much of each food you should eat to achieve your macronutrient goal, or how to get as reasonably close to your macro goal if it's not possible to eat 2000 grams of protein and 100 calories in just jellybeans.

In a nut shell, the Food simplex treats the inputted values as a system of linear equations and attempts to solve for a solution vector by means of Gauss Jordan elimination, projections, and the simplex algorithm.

Full specifications are in the foodsimplex pdf.
